jatasya hi dhruvo m?ityur dhruva? janma mitasya cha
tasmad apariharye ’rthe na tva? shochitum arhasi

(Death is certain for one who has been born, and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable)

– Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 27

The yakṣha was actually the celestial God of death, Yamraj, in disguise. He asked sixty questions, each of which was answered perfectly by Yudhishthir. One of these questions was: kim āśhcharyaṁ? “What is the most surprising thing in this world?” Yudhisthir replied:

ahany ahani bhūtāni gachchhantīha yamālayam
śheṣhāḥ sthiratvam ichchhanti kimāśhcharyamataḥ param (Mahabharat) [v30]

“At every moment people are dying. Those who are alive are witnessing this phenomenon, and yet they do not think that one day they will also have to die. What can be more astonishing than this?” Shree Krishna explains in this verse that life is inescapably a dead end, and so a wise person does not lament over the inevitable.
