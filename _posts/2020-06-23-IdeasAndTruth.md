So long as we cling to ideas, we are in a state in which there can be no experiencing at all. Then we are merely living in the field of time in the past, which gives further sensation, or in the future, which is another form of sensation, It is only when the mind is free from idea that there can be experiencing.

Ideas are not truth; and truth is something that must be experienced directly, from moment to moment. It is not an experience which you want--which is then merely sensation. Only when one can go beyond the bundle of ideas--which is the 'me', which is the mind, which has a partial or complete continuity--only when one can go beyond that, when thought is completely silent, is there a state of experiencing. Then one shall know what Truth is.
