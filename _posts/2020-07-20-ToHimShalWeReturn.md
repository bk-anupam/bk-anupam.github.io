title: To Him shall we return

I died a mineral and became a plant,
I died a plant and rose an animal,
I died an animal and I was man.
Why should I fear? When was I less by dying?
Yet once more I shall die as man, to soar
With the blessed angels; but even from angelhood
I must pass on. All except God perishes.
When I have sacrificed my angel soul,
I shall become that which no mind ever conceived.
O, let me not exist! for non-existence proclaims,
"To Him shall we return."
