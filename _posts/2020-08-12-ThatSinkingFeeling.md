A lot us are increasingly experiencing that sinking feeling that at times seems to pull us into a deep abyss. And there doesn't seem to be a visible reason for feeling like so. Nothing seems right, it feels like drifting alone in a vast ocean with no sight of horizon, not knowing whether we will ever get to see the land again.

The description of how it feels might seem poetic but isn't this what most of us are feeling in the deepest recesses of our heart. We all are connected by the fabric of consciousness. Wise men have told us this, haven't they. At some level or the other, majority of us have started to experience the very subtle repercussions of too much turmoil, negativity and violence that has penetrated the collective human psyche too deeply.

That is an attempt to put into words the problem that is afflicting human consciousness, the results of which have got too close for our comfort.

Depression, anxiety, panic attacks. Psychiatry gives it many names. Whatever it is, we can no longer afford to close our eyes and pretend 'all is well'. It's time to stop and give a long, hard look at our lives and see where have we gone wrong.
