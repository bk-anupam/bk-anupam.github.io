The need for action

What would be your reaction if you had nothing to do? At first you probably will rejoice in the rest that you so badly needed. As days pass by and having rested to your heartful, you plan to get back in action. As inaction prolongs, you start feeling restless. Being at rest feels like punishment. Being at peace is no longer desirable. Your longing for the cacophony of life increases as time passes.

Does this sound familiar? Have you ever wondered what causes this? Why is the mind so deeply addicted to action, why intellect feels restless as the peace prolongs. Ironical as it may sound, our attempts to acquire peace through meditation or spirituality are only meant to enable our voyages into deeper recesses of restless, incessant action.

All our identity is based on what we do, what we have done in the past, what we plan to do in the future. Our possessions, our relationships through the prism of which we define ourselves were acquired by virtue of being in continuous action. How could we cease to act? It's the question of the survival of our deeply cherished identity. Who cares if the identity itself is false. And who has the time to evaluate the quality of our actions. Life is short. We need to get there fast. But where are we heading?
