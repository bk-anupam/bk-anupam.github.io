Seeker in it's true sense is one looking deeply for something. That search is the purpose of his life. The quest usually starts with a deep desire to know something or to achieve an aim but as the seeker moves forward on the journey of his quest, he starts to enjoy the journey itself. He no longer restricts his endeavor within the narrow confines of the aim he set out to seek. For he knows that to reach an aim that is absolute the journey must never end. A seeker knows how to filter  the distractions and remains steadfastly focused on his aim fully aware that the aim is not stationary. As the seeker broadens his horizons and gets deeper insights, he starts transforming from within and it is this transformation that is a source of joy and fulfillment for the seeker. He no longer seeks joy outside but inside on the path of his quest he discovers everything he had ever longed for.  

And spirituality is one of the dimensions in which we can seek, the quest being an absolute one. A true seeker doesn't look for approval from society or peers. He treads the path seldom taken by others and is never in doubt for his goal acts as his guiding light. He blazes a trail that others follow. To the world he seems an outcast but the seeker is brimming with knowledge and wisdom and experience that the journey has taught him.

And despite all odds, single mindedly as he inches closer to his goal, radiating the light from within, he becomes a beacon of hope for the world
