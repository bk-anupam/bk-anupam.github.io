Truth is timeless, changeless and so is the wisdom emanating from the Truth. The wise and realized men have tried to point us to the path that takes us beyond time, space, mind and towards the Truth .The misfortune of man is that he can't conceive of an existence beyond time and space both of which exist in the mind alone. One is thought to be alive only when one can perceive through the senses, think through the mind. We haven't known any other existence. And the irony is, our mind alone is the only proof of our existence, the way we define it. It's kind of a self contained system where in the world exists because of the mind and the mind exists because of the world. 

What truly exists can only be verified by Someone who is outside of this self contained system, also referred to as Maya or The Illusion.
