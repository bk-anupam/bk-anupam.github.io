	<p>I'll spare you the agony of boasting about my professional credentials or my technical skills as they don't define me. </p>
	<p>I am in search of THE TRUTH. I am a seeker of knowledge. I am trying to explore life with an open mind and learning just for the joy of it. And all I've realized in my journey of life so far can be summarized in two points </p
	<ul>
		<li>The only thing I know is that I know nothing</li>
		<li>The end of the mind is the begining of THE TRUTH</li>
	</ul>	
	<p>Meanwhile my journey continues ... </p>
